## Buy One, Get One Free

### Description

In this coding interview, the task is to implement a "Buy One, Get One Free" feature using Laravel and PHP. The feature allows customers to purchase a specific product and receive another one of the same product for free.

We have two products:

| Code | Name                 | Price | Quantity | Buy One Get One Free |
|------|----------------------|-------|----------|----------------------|
| P-1  | Coffee Frappuccino   | 180   | 1        | Yes                  |
| P-2  | Ham & Cheese Toastie | 205   | 1        | No                   |


### Requirements

If a customer purchases a product with the "Buy One Get One Free" offer, they will receive another one of the same product for free. If a customer purchases a product without the "Buy One Get One Free" offer, they will only receive one of the product.
